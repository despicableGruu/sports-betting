#  Sports Betting Platform

This application allows users to place bets on sports fixtures, specifically focusing on football (soccer) matches. It leverages a third-party API to fetch real-time data, manage user accounts, and process bets automatically.

**Key Features:**

* **Data Integration:** Retrieves football data (fixtures, teams, standings, etc.) from an external API.
* **Betting Functionality:** Enables users to wager on match outcomes (home win, draw, away win).
* **Automated Odds Calculation:** Dynamically calculates betting odds based on current league standings and updates them after each match.
* **Automatic Result Processing:** Monitors match statuses and automatically calculates bet payouts when fixtures are concluded.
* **Scheduled Tasks:** Utilizes a task scheduler (e.g., Celery) to automate data updates, odds calculations, and result processing.
* **User Management:** Allows users to create accounts, place bets, and manage their betting history.
* **Email Notifications:** Sends confirmation emails upon successful bet placement.
* **Team Standings History:** Maintains historical team standings and visualizes them through charts or graphs.
* **RESTful API:** Exposes data (e.g., standings, fixture details) through a RESTful API.


**Getting Started:**

1. **Obtain API Key:** Register with the external sports data API provider and retrieve your unique API key.
2. **Configure API Connection:** Update the application's configuration file (e.g., settings.py) with your API key.
3. **Database Setup:** Migrate the database schema using the appropriate command-line tool (e.g., `python manage.py migrate`).
4. **Create Admin User:** Generate a superuser account for administrative purposes (e.g., `python manage.py createsuperuser`).
5. **Task Scheduler Setup:** Configure and start the task scheduler (e.g., Celery) to handle scheduled tasks like data updates.
6. **Start Application:** Run the application's web server (e.g., `python manage.py runserver`).
7. **Initialize Competitions:** Use the admin panel to add the sports competitions you want to include in the platform.
8. **User Registration:** Register new users and start placing bets.


**Core Components:**

* **Data Model:** Defines the data structures (e.g., teams, fixtures, users, bets) for storing and managing data.
* **API Integration:** Handles communication with the external sports data API.
* **Betting Engine:** Processes bets, manages odds calculations, and handles bet payouts.
* **Task Scheduler:** Orchestrates background tasks using Celery or a similar tool.
* **User Interface:** Provides a web-based interface for users to access and interact with the platform.
* **Admin Panel:** Allows administrators to manage the platform's settings, data, and user accounts.


**Endpoints:**

The application exposes a set of endpoints for accessing data and interacting with the platform's functionalities:

* `/competitions/`: List all available sports competitions.
* `/competition/{id}/`: Display details about a specific competition, including its fixtures.
* `/teams/`: Display a list of all teams participating in the chosen competitions.
* `/team/{id}/`: Show details about a specific team.
* `/fixtures/`: List all upcoming or past fixtures.
* `/fixture/{id}/`: Display details about a specific fixture, including betting options.
* `/users/`: Manage user accounts (registration, login, logout).
* `/user/{id}/`: Display details about a specific user (e.g., betting history).
* `/bets/`: View all bets placed by users.
* `/bet/{id}/`: View details about a specific bet.
* `/admin/`: Access the administrative dashboard for managing the platform.
